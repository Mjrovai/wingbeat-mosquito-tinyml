## Data and Code repository for "Classifying mosquito wingbeat sound using TinyML"

Every year more than one billion people are infected and morethan one million people die from vector-borne diseases includingmalaria, dengue, zika and chikungunya. Mosquitoes are the bestknown disease vector and are geographically spread worldwide.It is important to raise awareness of mosquito proliferation bymonitoring their incidence, especially in poor regions. Acoustic de-tection of mosquitoes has been studied for long and ML can be usedto automatically identify mosquito species by their wingbeat. Wepresent a prototype solution based on an openly available dataset,on the Edge Impulse platform and on three commercially-availableTinyML devices. The proposed solution is low-power, low-cost andcan run without human intervention in resource-constrained areas.This insect monitoring system can reach a global scale.
